//to find out what data type if has to be
type(of: myResult1)
type(of: myResult2)
// to resolve this we could add in a type annotation let myResult2: double = a / b. THIS WOULDL NOT WORK as we dont have implicit convertion between types but we could do it as Double(a / b). This convertion would still not work however as would only print 2.0

//OPTIONALS
//var and let are not set to default values like other languages. e.g. in C a var strng is set to "" a int will be 0 default. Not in swift

//we add a ? after type name. as an example if we want a middle name but one isnt supplied we would make that optional so it doesnt populate as ""
var firstName: String
var middleName: String? //will make it optional but will still have the same datatype i.e int,boolean etc
var lastName: String

//Useing optional values
var reguarInt: Int
var optionalInt: Int?

//can set values
reguarInt = 100
optionalInt =  nil //or nil

//later operation using optional
reguarInt = reguarInt + 5
//optionalInt = optionalInt + 5 //it wont let you because what if it is nil

//check for nill in a long winded way
//if optionalInt != nil{
  //  var unwrappedInt = optionalInt! //this is called forced unwrapping
//}

//better way Optional Binding

//Collections being arrays - ordered collection of items, dictionary a collection of key pairs and set's an unmonitored collection of items
// Arrays are 0 based so 10 items indexed 0-9, they are type - safe (i.e all int or all strings) and can be var or let

//make a variable array of strings

//String Interpolation - to alter a string
// you can use contatination so a + b
// \() is all you need

//example data

//...
//let message = "Now playing TRACK by ARTIST which is DURATION seconds"
let message = "Now playing \(trackName) by \(artistName) which is \(duration) long"
print (message)

//you dont even need the let message = you can simple print and put it in
print ("Now playing \(trackName) by \(artistName) which is \(duration) long")
//you can even work with stuff so we can change duration from seconds to round minets and % sign for the remainder
print ("Now playing \(trackName) by \(artistName) which is \(duration / 60)m \(duration % 60)secs long")
